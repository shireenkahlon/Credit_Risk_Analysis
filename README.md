# Credit_Risk_Analysis
This project will use supervised machine learning processes to check for fraudulent credit card applications

##Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project is to build a supervised machine learning model which will predict strong and weak applications for loans. The machine learning model is designed to create training and testing datasets from the original dataset, while using different techniques, such as random oversampling, SMOTE, and SMOTEENN to balance the imbalances in the data between the two target classes. The end result of this project will assist my client, Fast Lending, in predicting which applications they should accept or reject for loans. For reference, 0 represents the loans that are the “bad applications” or the application that would be recommended for rejection. On the other hand, 1 represents the “good applications” or the loan applications that would be accepted. 

##Results
The first model shows random oversampling on the original data. This method will increase the number of data points in the minority target class to match the number in the majority class. The results, as shown below, display the accuracy score to be 64%; the accuracy score is the percentage of predictions that are correct compared to the y testing values. However, 64% is a low percentage to rely upon for incoming data. The next statistic, precision, looks at how accurate the predictions are for each target class. The average for the precision is high but as we can see in the results below, the model often predicts class 0 values wrong. The recall looks at the actual numbers versus the predictions. The recall for class 0 is relatively high, at 0.71; a recall of 0.71 is saying that less than 3 out of 4 of the actual results were predicted correctly. On the other hand, the recall for class 1 is barely over half — 0.57; this shows us that a little over half of the actual results for class 1 were predicted correctly. Now that recall and precision have been explained, we can examine the remainder of the results from the different balancing imbalanced data methods.
